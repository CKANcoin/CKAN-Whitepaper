3. Blockchain and Technology
3.1 Blockchain Integration: Binance Smart Chain (BSC)
CKAN operates on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), known for its scalability, speed, and low transaction costs. The integration with BSC ensures that CKAN transactions are secure, efficient, and cost-effective. BSC’s compatibility with decentralized exchanges (DEX) like PancakeSwap provides liquidity options that align with CKAN’s growth.
3.2 CKAN Smart Contracts
CKAN utilizes smart contracts to automate and execute predefined actions within the blockchain. These contracts enhance the functionality of CKAN, allowing for programmable and trustless interactions. The smart contracts are audited for security and compliance, ensuring the safety and integrity of the network.
Security and Transparency
The CKAN smart contract code is open-source and available for public review, contributing to full transparency and community trust. Additionally, third-party audits are conducted regularly to ensure no vulnerabilities are present.
